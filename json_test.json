        "9:55 the wolves are litterally what makes this build so busted. For some reason your pets ALSO have all your auras, and all their damage bonuses. Basically a 7-800% multiplier",
        "I recently switched to a build that kind of combines wing strikes with auradin. All 3 auras, Arbiter of justice, condemn and consecration. You gear it towards wing strikes but throw on the dawnfire gloves and just evade everywhere. The auras just melts small enemies. Condemn stacks up the ascension aspect more quickly. Consecration for whenever. The wing strikes hit very hard on elites",
        "To explain why you want wolves on auradin, it's because your holy light aura gets copied to them so when you have 8+ wolves out all pushing out that aura shit gets whacky. And hell you can just use the barrier with nagu and the one that puts out when not taking damage to summon the wolves and still not need to push buttons."

        "Paladin doesn’t need a nerf, every other class needs a rework. Castle has a natural soft cap. \n\nWhat makes Paladin so strong is the synergies baked into the tree and paragon boards. All the boards are damage with some QOL mixed in, there are enough boards that are build agnostic that no matter what you make you’re not having to hodgepodge non-synergistic boards together later,  and all the build diversity is in the skill tree and uniques.\n\nIt _feels_ overpowered by comparison because every other class feels like they are fighting themselves due to how the damage scaling is stacked. You can pick any skill on the tree for Paladin and make a *GOOD* build around it, you cannot do that with any other class.",

        "Dont let these build stop you from having fun. These builds involved people getting perfect items/legendary to mythic sanct gears. 1 and 1million mythic sanct."

        "I have the same build, got a crazy sanctification of 100% crit damage which doubled my overall crit damage, too.  Love this build, and thank you as always :)",
        "This building is so much fun. It is more enjoyable to participate in an onslaught of different skills happening all at once through one or two buttons the screen looks amazing. The sounds and  animations moving across the screen is more fulfilling than the Paladin. I’ll always be a Sorc in the end!",
        "Can't quite hit trillions with that set up yet. I'm almost through Tier 100. Just can't dish the damage quite yet. Getting there though. This helped. I was only getting half way through. Now I can get 3/4th."

        "Paladin. They fixed all the broken thorns skills. But thorns only procs via retribution and that only triggers with blocking. The key is stacking lots of max resolve stacks and refilling instantly via Aegis. It's also very tanky with the aspect that grants 0.4% per life steal per thorn. \nAlso entirely different build is using Zeal by doubling grandfather's and adding GAs to life on hit to your rings and gloves. With 100% crit chance and well over 10k crit damage it destroys everything.",
        "Most Used does not equal Best Paladin Build. My Auradin Build does more damage than either of the Paladin Builds shown here. It does quadrillions of damage. However I will admit it is one of the Paladin builds that takes longer to complete than any other I’ve tried. So that may be the reason it’s not seen as often. I’m nearly level 230 and just now getting around to completing the build. The Build was already doing Trillions of damage before I had the Mythic Helm or Chest Piece. Now that I have both it does much more. I can also go AFK and not die. However if you’re afk to long. You do get logged out."
